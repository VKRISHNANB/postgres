You set the collation at the server level when you initially install SQL Server. 
The collation serves as the default collation for all system databases and user databases, unless a different collation is specified at the database or column level. 
You can assign any collation at the server instance, except Unicode-only collations.

When you define a user database, you can set the default collation as part of the database definition.
To specify a collation when creating a user database, you add a COLLATE clause to the database definition. The clause must point to one of the collations supported by your SQL Server instance. As with server-level collations, you cannot specify a Unicode-only collation. To test this out, letâ€™s try to create a database using the Indic_General_100_CS_AS collation:

USE master;
  GO
  DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS TestCollations;
  GO
  CREATE DATABASE TestCollations
  COLLATE Indic_General_100_CS_AS;
  GO
  
We can also use the COLLATE clause in an ALTER DATABASE statement if we want to change the default collation:

ALTER DATABASE TestCollations
  COLLATE Latin1_General_100_CI_AS;
  GO
